### Hi there!
💾 I'm a _computer archaeologist_. I like preserving old software by reverse engineering their logic/file formats and documenting them in open-sourced code. I call this "archaeology" because there’s lots of interesting information from computer generations past, but it’s “buried” in proprietary formats. My role is to “dig up” this information and put it “on display” for this generation. Please join me in preserving quality software from bygone ages!
